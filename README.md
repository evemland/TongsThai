## Final Project - Tong's Thai

This is a revised version of the Tong's Thai restaurant's current website. I have used the website many times and realized it is a bit confusing and difficult to navigate and use. I have recreated the website to deliver information about their menu and ordering systems more directly, to look better, and ultimately function better.

Tong's Thai is my favorite restaurant. They serve great quality sushi and at a decent price, two things that *really* make this girl happy. I've been thinking about revising this website as my final project for a long time now, and am happy I'll get to make a website, one I consistently use, function better.
